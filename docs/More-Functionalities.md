The **Better Rolls 2 for Savage Worlds** module has some additional functionality:

## Drag and Drop

You can also use the weapon or power icon to drag it over the actor you want to target. It will execute the "Show card and trait roll" action.

![Drag and Drop](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/blob/version_2/docs/img/drag_and_drop_v-1-2-10.gif?raw=true)

For easier accessibility, instead of dragging the icon on an actor, you can also drag it to the macro bar, creating an automatic macro instead.

## Custom Bennies

The module comes with some custom bennies that can be found in the assets/bennies folder.

Currently, it ships with some classical roman and greek coins.

## Global actions

The module let's you define your own actions, see this [GLOBAL ACTIONS](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/wiki/Global-Actions):

## Macros and API

The following information assumes a passing knowledge of both javascript and Foundry API. It's geared towards macro or module developers.

The module exposes an API in game.brsw.

```js
game.brsw.add_actions(actions)
/**
 * Adds an array of actions to the available ones. The array should be in the same format as builtin-actions.js.
 * The array is cleared when reloading and should be set again
 * @param {Array} actions
 */
```    

You can learn more about this at: [GLOBAL ACTIONS API](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/wiki/Global-Actions#api).

```js
game.brsw.create_attribute_card()
/**
 * Creates a chat card for an attribute
 *
 * @param {Token, SwadeActor} origin  The actor or token owning the attribute
 * @param {string} name The name of the attribute like 'vigor'
 * @return {Promise} A promise for the BrCommonCard object
 */
```

```js
game.brsw.create_attribute_card_from_id(token_id, actor_id, name)
/**
 * Creates an attribute card from a token or actor id
 *
 * @param {string} token_id A token id, if it can be solved it will be used
 *  before actor
 * @param {string} actor_id An actor id, it could be set as fallback or
 *  if you keep token empty as the only way to find the actor
 * @param {string} name Name of the attribute to roll, like 'vigor'
 * @return {Promise} a promise fot the ChatMessage object
 */
 ```

```js
game.brsw.roll_attribute(br_card, expend_bennie)
/**

 * @param {BrCommonCard} br_card The card being rolled
 * @param {boolean} expend_bennie True if we want to spend a bennie
