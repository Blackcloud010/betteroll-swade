#### Show Better Rolls card (Default)

This option will display the Better Rolls card in the Chat Log, when single clicking on a Trait, Weapon or Power. This option is useful if you need to add some settings on the card itself (like global actions, e.g., Wild Attack, changes in Ammo or Power Point handling).

#### Show the card and open the action dialog

This option will display the Better Rolls card and automatically open the action selection dialog.

#### Show card and trait roll

This option will display the Better Rolls card and automatically roll the selected trait *(powers and weapons rely on the arcane/weapon skill)*. It will automatically factor in the Better Rolls modifiers selected in the action dialog, as well as modifications through Wounds, Fatigue, or states like *Distracted* or *Vulnerable*. Additionally, the selected “Modifiers for Better Rolls” will apply.

#### Show card and roll trait and damage

As above, and the damage will also be automatically rolled, assuming the Target Number is matched.

#### Default system roll

This will open the default modification popup window of the SWADE rule system.

## Other Options

Other options allow to switch on and off the automatic ammo and power point handling, the uploading of custom benny images and the option to select a different Dice So Nice! theme for your damage dice.
