# Global Actions Documentation

Global actions are a json encoded set of instructions that allow the user to customize how Better Rolls work.

**Example Action**
```json
{
   "id":"LEG",
   "name":"Called Shot: Leg",
   "button_name":"Leg Remover",
   "skillMod":-4,
   "dmgMod":4,
   "dmgOverride":"",
   "selector_type":"item_type",
   "selector_value":"weapon"
}
```

This piece of json will add an action called "Leg Remover" to every weapon card.
If this action is checked it will add a penalty of 4 to the skill roll and a bonus of 4 to the damage roll.

**Needed fields:**

* id: Any string, needs to be different for each action.
* name: The name of the action.
* button_name: The name that will be displayed on the icon. Will be made optional in some update.

**Optional fields:**

* skillMod: A number to be used as a modifier to the related skill roll.
* dmgMod: A number that will be used as a modifier for damage roll
* dmgOverride: A foundry die expression that will be rolled for damage instead of the weapon default.
* defaultChecked: If this key exists the action button will start pinned (marked in red)
* runSkillMacro: This key will run a macro named like its value after skill roll.
* runDamageMacro: This key will run a macro named like its value after damage roll.
* raiseDamageFormula: A string, specify here the formula used to add damage in the event of a raise. The default formula is "+1d6x", so any substitution should be done in a similar way, i.e. "+1d10x" to add a normal exploding d10.
* wildDieFormula: Another string dice formula, this time used for the Wild Die. Remember to specify the exploding. You can use an empty string for no wild die.
* rerollSkillMod: A number used as a modifier for skill reroll
* rerollDamageMod: A number used as a modifier for damage reroll
* shotsUsed: A number that makes the action use that number of shots. If the item is a power, it will make it use that number of PPs instead.
* rof: Numer of trait dice rolled.
* tnOverride: A number that is set as the tn of the roll. Note that this takes precedence from other ways of setting the target number like targeting.
* extra_text: Extra text to be shown in the card, it accepts HTML.
* overrideAp: Override the Armor Penetration value of the item.

**Selector fields:**

This group of fields are used to select when the action is available, you will need to specify a selector_type and a selector_value for a simple selection. You can also use and_selector and give it a list of simple selectors.

**selector_type:**
* skill: selector_value must be a string. The action will be available when the item uses a skill with that name
* attribute: selector_value must be a string. The action will be available when the attribute named is rolled. (eg, strength, agility, spirit, smarts, vigor)
* item_type: selector_value must be another string, a valid SWADE item type: weapon, power, edge, ...
* actor_name: selector_value must be a string. The action will be avaliable to actor that include that string in their name.
* item_name: selector value must be again a string that this time is compared with the item name.
* actor_has_effect: Another string selector, will select actors that have an enabled effect whose label contains the string.
* actor_has_edge: The same, this time it will look for an edge that contains that string.
* actor_has_hindrance: Like the last two, but for hindrances.
* actor_has_major_hindrance: This one only matches is the hindrance is major.
* actor_has_ability: Like the last three, but for special abilities.
* all: It will always show this action.
* actor_has_joker: The action will only be avaliable when the actor is in combat and has drawn a joker.
* target_has_edge: This action will be avaliable if PRIOR TO CLICKING the icon, the user has selected a target that has some edge.
* target_has_hindrance: This action is like actor_has_edge but fires for target hindrances
* target_has_major_hindrance: This other action only fires when the target has a major hindrance that includes the text in the value
* item_description_includes: This action will be shown if the item description includes the value.
* actor_additional_stat_xxx: This action will be present if an actor has an additional stat named xxx and its value is equal to what is in selector_value. You need to substitute xxx with the additional stat name.

**complex_selectors:**
* and_selector: Takes a list of the above selectors and executes the action if all are true i.e: 'and_selector'. As an example the following json will select and item that uses fighting skill and is owned by an actor whose name includes Jhon.
* or_selector: Takes a list of selectors and executes the action if at least one is true
* not_selector: Takes a list of only on selector and executes the action if that selector conditions are NOT met.

```  
and_selector: [
{'selector_type': 'skill', 'selector_value':'figthing}, 
{'selector_type':'actor', 'selector_value': 'Jhon'}
]
```

# Macros:
The following variables are pre-populated in a macro run from global actions for macro writer convenience.
Note that all info is already stored in the message, all the other are just conveniences.

```
const actor = actor_param; // The card actor
const item = item_param; // The card item
const speaker = ChatMessage.getSpeaker();
const token = canvas.tokens.get(speaker.token);
const character = game.user.character;
const message = message_param; // The full message objetc
```

# Grouping

This tag lets you group the actions, it is not mandatory, but it will be used in the card in some next update.

* group: A string containing a group name, actions with the same name will be shown grouped in the card (in some future version)
