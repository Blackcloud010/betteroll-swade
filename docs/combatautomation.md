Change the height of a token by right clicking it and adding +/- and a number to the heigth box in the right left corner.

# Gang Up

- You must set the PCs as Friendly.
- You must set the hostile NPCs as Hostile.

The three tokens are set to Hostile. The token in the middle will receive +2 to attack the PC token. You can check p101 from SWADE core or ![Gang Up](https://www.pegforum.com/forum/savage-worlds/official-answers-on-core-rules/51683-about-gang-up) too.
