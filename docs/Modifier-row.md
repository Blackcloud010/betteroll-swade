Better Rolls 2 adds a section above the chat window allowing you to set up generic **"one-time"** modifiers for your next roll (one click, white highlight), or **"persistent"**, i.e. all rolls until toggled off (double click, red highlight).

If you prefer this section to start hidden, you can find an option to collapse it by default in the settings.

The Player's Chat Window has the same functionality as the GM's Character Chat Window, but limited to just the players trait and damage rolls.

## GM's view

You can use this to quickly add modifiers to a roll. Note that it adds all the selected modifiers, that way you can click on 2 and 1 or 4 and -1 to get add 3 to a roll.

You can either set a **one-time** modifier or a **persistent** modifier. If you click once, the selected icon will turn white and will be deselected after one roll. Click twice, it will turn red and will apply to any roll until you deselect it.

Use the "Trait roll modifier" line to affect any trait roll either from a skill, attribute or item.

Use "Number of trait dice" to use multiple trait dice on a skill roll, either from a skill, attribute or item card.

Finally, the "Damage roll modifier" adds the selected number to damage rolls.

The Master's mod line will turn red with one click and will stay on red until you click it again. It will add the modifier to all the rolls (trait or damage) of every actor, either player or GM controlled. Note that this selection survives reloads and the closing of the world.

The Illumination mod line will turn red with one click and will stay on red until you click it again. It will add the modifier to all trait rolls ***(but not damage rolls)*** of every actor, either player or GM controlled. Note that this selection survives reloads and the closing of the world.
